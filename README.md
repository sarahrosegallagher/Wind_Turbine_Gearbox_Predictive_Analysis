# Wind Turbine Reliability Analysis

## Background

* Selected topic and reason


Wind turbine reliability. Decrease cost and increase reliability. The intent is to build a machine learning algorithm to predict wind turbine failure. A major component failure occurs on average annually on a wind turbine. With high repair costs for catostrophic failures, predicting these failures would lead to a much lower cost in maintainence. 

* Data source description

Real time monitoring data for 29 wind turbines on 66 features from 2019 to 2020. Measurements averaged and recorded every 10 minutes. 10 million records for 19 features of interest for gearbox performance. 

* Questions we hope to answer with data 

Which features that are measured can give a leading indicator on gearbox failure?

Can we predict wind turbine gearbox failure with sensor data?

## Communication Protocols 

* GitHub

* Slack

* Google Drive

* Zoom Meetings 


## Models
After preliminary data cleaning and transformation we intend to investigate the data descriptive statistics, histograms, and feature correlations to the targets. After which, some features may be dropped or merged depending on results. Next we intend to conduct a K-Means unsupervised Machine learning analysis to further investigate grouping within the data to inform the analysis design. Next, we intend to use a Random Forest supervised learning model to predict turbine failure withing a target window.
